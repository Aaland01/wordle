# Wordle 

Originally created on CodePen as three separate parts. Combined locally for ease of use. 

Primarily developed for work purposes, but refined and built on hobby basis. 

Project created as a template or framework for a middle-school programming project. Made by me gain insight into how a student might go foreward with creating a wordle-like guessing game. Starting from 1 letter and simple design, and upgrading along the way to what is "stage3", a complete design for a functional wordle application. 

### Missing functionality

- No implementation for checking whether a guessed word is an actual word (eeeee is a valid guess)
- No limit for guessing.
- The correct word is hardcoded to script. No implementation for generating a random word each day like actual wordle
